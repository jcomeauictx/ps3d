A simple extended postscript interpreter for creating 3 dimensional objects

I made several half-assed attempts at using some freeware CAD programs, and
wasn't able to figure out how to make even simple solids. I longed for a
language like PostScript with three-dimensional operations.

I envision this being for more than simple .obj or .stl file creation; with
operators such as `drill`, `tap`, `mill`, `extrude`, and `pathrotate3d`,
the language could directly control drill presses, milling machines, and
pottery wheels.
